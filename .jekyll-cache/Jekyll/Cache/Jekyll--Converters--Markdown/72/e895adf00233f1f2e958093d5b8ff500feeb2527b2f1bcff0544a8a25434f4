I"7<p>In this article I want to share a simple game I created on Arduino with 8x8 LED matrix created on a single breadboard. The main goal was to build a game console with all components located on a single breadboard.</p>

<h2 id="components">Components</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Breadboard</li>
  <li>Arduino UNO</li>
  <li>8x8 LED matrix</li>
  <li>Driver MAX7219</li>
  <li>4 Buttons</li>
  <li>Bunch of wires</li>
  <li>four 470 Ohm resistors</li>
  <li>one 10 kOhm resistor</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="software-requirements">Software requirements</h2>

<p>You need to have:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Arduino IDE</li>
  <li><a href="http://playground.arduino.cc/Main/LedControl">LedControl library</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/itdxer/ArduinoGame">Gameâ€™s source code</a></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="connections">Connections</h2>

<p>I wonâ€™t explain it in details. I just will put a couple of photos that will show you how to set up the most important connections.</p>

<p><img src="/images/arduino-game/console-front.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Arduino is on the backside of the breadboard.</p>

<p><img src="/images/arduino-game/console-back.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Arduino is not attached to the back side of the breadboard. Wires are strained in this way just to simply hold Arduino in place.</p>

<img src="/images/arduino-game/arduino-pins.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Four buttons are connected to the Analog Input PINs from A0 to A3.</p>

<ul>
  <li>A0 - Connects to the button that shoots from the right side of the spaceship</li>
  <li>A1 - Connects to the button that shoots from the left side of the spaceship</li>
  <li>A2 - Connects to the button that moves spaceship to the left</li>
  <li>A3 - Connects to the button that moves spaceship to the right</li>
</ul>

<p>Three wires are connected to PINs 10, 11 and 12.</p>

<ul>
  <li>PING 12 - DATA IN-pin</li>
  <li>PING 11 - CLK-pin</li>
  <li>PING 10 - LOAD(/CS)-pin</li>
</ul>

<p>The most messy part is the one that connects MAX7219 driver to LED matrix.</p>

<p>The first matrix input goes into the hole near number 25 at the bottom of the photo.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s hard to understand something just by looking at this photo. In case if need some more information you can check this <a href="http://tronixstuff.com/2013/10/11/tutorial-arduino-max7219-led-display-driver-ic/">Tutorial</a>. It has a <a href="http://tronixstuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/MAX7219_example_LED_matrix_circuit.jpg">scheme</a> that helps you connect these components.</p>

<h2 id="useful-resources">Useful resources</h2>

<p>During the building process I found a few useful resources that helped me build this device.</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="http://tronixstuff.com/2013/10/11/tutorial-arduino-max7219-led-display-driver-ic/">Tutorial</a> that helps connect MAX7219 driver and LED matrix</li>
  <li><a href="http://blog.riyas.org/2013/12/online-led-matrix-font-generator-with.html">Online tool</a> that helps create binary images and save them as an array of hex/binary values.</li>
</ol>
