<p>This problem is based on the following tweet</p>

<h2 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer</h2>

<p>All of the results has been obtained before the answer was revealed in the
video. Simple observations will match those mentioned in the video, but the core
part is different and doesn‚Äôt require building connection between problem and
hyperspheres.</p>

<h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>

<h3 id="observations">Observations</h3>

<p>We always start a game with a score equal to 1, so we will never can get any
score less then one, which means that expected score has to be greater than 1.</p>

<p>Next, it‚Äôs easy to calculate probability of gaining another score. Considering
that points are sampled randomly from the uniformal distribution it‚Äôs easy to
calculate probability of gaining second score. All we need to do is just divide
area of a circle by the area of a square.</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">P(\text{Gaining second score after the first throw}) =
\frac{S_{circle}}{S_{square}} = \frac{\pi r^2}{l^2} = \frac{\pi}{4}</script>

<p>Probability is larger than 50% which means that more than half of the times we
should gain second score. It means that the expected value also should be
greater than 2.</p>

<h3 id="calculating-radius-of-the-new-circle">Calculating radius of the new circle</h3>

<p>It‚Äôs easy to find radius of the new circle using Pythagorean theorem</p>

<p><img src="/images/2019-11-24-expected-value-of-the-unusual-game-of-darts_12_0.png" alt="png" /></p>

<p>where,</p>

<p>\(r\) - radius of a circle</p>

<p>\(d\) - distance from center of a circle to a randomly samplde point within
that circle</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">d = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}, \text{where } x, y \text{ ~ } U(-1, 1)</script>

<p>\(r_{new}\) - radius of a new circle</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">r_{new} = \sqrt{r^2 - d^2} = \sqrt{r^2 - x^2 - y^2}</script>

<p>or</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">r_{new}^2 = r^2 - x^2 - y^2</script>

<h3 id="expected-value">Expected value</h3>

<p>From the definition of the expected value we know that</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\mathbb{E}[s] = \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} i \cdot {P(s = i)}</script>

<p>Since we know that \(i\) is a positive integer we can rewrite this sequnce in
the following way</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\begin{align}
\mathbb{E}[s] &= \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} i \cdot {P(s = i)} = \\
              &= \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} \sum_{j=1}^{i} {P(s = i)} = \\
              &= \sum_{j=1}^{\infty} \sum_{i=j}^{\infty} {P(s = i)} = \\
              &= \sum_{j=1}^{\infty} P(s \geq j)
\end{align} %]]></script>

<p>We can unroll the sequence in order to look at a few first terms</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\begin{align}
\mathbb{E}[s] &= \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} P(s \geq i) \\
              &= P(s \geq 1) + P(s \geq 2) + P(s \geq 3) + P(s \geq 4) + ...
\end{align} %]]></script>

<p>From the previous observatios we know that \(P(s \geq 1)=1\) and \(P(s \geq
2)=\frac{\pi}{4}\). Value for the \(P(s \geq 3)\) is less straight forward,
since new circle will depend on the random variable obtained from the previous
round, but it can be calculated.</p>

<h3 id="calculating-ps-geq-3">Calculating \(P(s \geq 3)\)</h3>

<h4 id="decomposing-probability-into-simpler-terms">Decomposing probability into simpler terms</h4>

<p>The biggest difference between \(P(s \geq 2)\) and \(P(s \geq 3)\) is that
first one is based on the circle with a constant radius where in the second one
it‚Äôs random and based on the outcome of the first round.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs important to note that we can play second round only when the first one was
successful, which means that</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">P(s \geq 3) = P(s \geq 2) P(W\text{ | }g=2)</script>

<p>where, \(P(W\text{ | }g=2)\) means probability of sampling random point
within a circle in the second round (g=game, W=win)</p>

<p>In fact, it‚Äôs true for any round</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">P(s \geq i + 1) = P(s \geq i) P(W\text{ | }g=i)</script>

<h4 id="distribution-of-circles-for-the-next-round">Distribution of circles for the next round</h4>

<p>Since in the second round radius of a circle is random, we need find
distribution of radiuses, before we can derive probability of winning the second
round.</p>

<p>We know the radius squared after successfull first round will be equal to</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">r_{new}^2 = r^2 - x^2 - y^2</script>

<p>From this formula, it‚Äôs hard to see distrubution of squared radiuses for two
reasons. First, random variables are squared and added together. Second, we
cannot take into account all the numbers, since \(r_{new}\) cannot be
calculated when the game was lost (for example, we lose when \(x=1\) and
\(y=1\)), which means that original uniformal distrubution was modified (no
it‚Äôs conditioned on the fact that point is in the circle).</p>

<p>Problem could be simplified by moving \(x\) and \(y\) into the polar
coordinate system</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">x = \rho \cos(\phi)
\\
y = \rho \sin(\phi)</script>

<p>where</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\begin{align}
&\rho = r \sqrt{u} \\
&u \text{ ~ } U(0, 1) \\
&\phi \text{ ~ } U(0, 2\pi)
\end{align} %]]></script>

<p>Since we are interested in the \(r_{new}^2\) distribution \(\phi\) can be
ignored</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\begin{align}
r_{new}^2 &= r^2 - x^2 - y^2 = \\
          &= r^2 - r^2 u \cos^2(\phi) - r^2 u \sin^2(\phi) = \\
          &= r^2 (1 - u)
\end{align} %]]></script>

<p>since \(u\) is sampled from the uniformal distrubution, the \(r_{new}^2\)
will be also sampled from the uniformal distribution (scaling and shifting
doesn‚Äôt have any effect on the frequency of the random variables and therefore
shape of the distribution will remain unchanged). Because \(S=\pi \cdot r^2\),
the distribution of circle areas is also uniformal.</p>

<p>The closer randomly sampled point to the circle center the larger will be the
radius of a new circle.</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
d_1 > d_2 \Rightarrow d_1^2 > d_2^2 \Rightarrow r^2 - d_1^2 < r^2 - d_2^2
\Rightarrow S_1 < S_2 %]]></script>

<p>From this it follows that</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\begin{align}
P(W\text{ | }g=2) &= E[x^2 + y^2 < r^2] = \\
                  &= \frac{\mathbb{E}[S_o]}{4} = \\
                  &= \frac{\pi \cdot \mathbb{E}[r_{new}^2]}{4} \\
                  &= \frac{\pi \cdot r^2 \cdot (1 - \mathbb{E}[u])}{4} \\
                  &= \frac{\pi \cdot r^2 \cdot (1 - 0.5)}{4} \\
                  &= \frac{\pi}{8}
\end{align} %]]></script>

<p>and</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\begin{align}
P(s \geq 3) &= P(s \geq 2) P(W\text{ | }g=2) \\
            &= \frac{\pi}{4} \cdot \frac{\pi}{8} \\
            &= \frac{\pi^2}{32}
\end{align} %]]></script>

<h3 id="calculating-ps-geq-4">Calculating \(P(s \geq 4)\)</h3>

<p>The \(P(s \geq 4)\) probability corresponds to the third throw and, as before,
we need to find probability of hitting a circle for the third time \(P(W\text{
| }g=3)\). Now problem got harder, since we need to estimate expected area of a
circle after two successful throws. Calculations for the circle after one
succsssful throw was easy, since the initial circle had a fixed radius. We want
to know what is the average circle produced by every possible circle with center
in the origin and radius less then or equal to the radius of the original
circle.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs consider two extrem cases. There is only one way of getting circle that
has the same radius as the original after two throws. It can happen only if we
hit origin two times in the row. The other extrem cases is that we get circle
with radius 0 which can happen only when we hit edge of a circle. There are way
more possibilities of getting circle with radius equal to zero, since each
possible circle produced after the first throw be used to generate a new circle
with a radius equal to zero. There are definitely more cases for the second
extrem compare to the first one which means that distribution of the areas is no
longer uniformal.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs consider another case. What is the probability of getting a circle after a
second throw with the half the area of the original circle. We know that this
number has to be greater than for area equal to \(r^2\) and less than for the
area equal to 0, since if after the first throw we get circle with area \(0.2
r^2\) that we cannot get circle with area \(0.5 r^2\) after the second throw.
The image below shows with a red color all of the points within a green circle
that will not be able to produce new circle with radius greater than half of the
original circle. Even if we will be able to hit the green area of the circle in
the first throw our changes of getting circle with area \(0.5 \pi r^2\) will
be lower when generated point is closer to the origin.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2019-11-24-expected-value-of-the-unusual-game-of-darts_19_0.png" alt="png" /></p>

<p>Following this logic we can design function that defines distribution of the
circle areas after the second throw.</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">f_2(x) = \int_0^{r^2 - x} f_1(x + z) \, q(z) \, dz</script>

<p>where</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
f_1(z) = q(z) = \begin{cases}
\frac{1}{r^2},& 0\leqslant z\leqslant{r^2}\\
0,&\text{otherwise.}
\end{cases} %]]></script>

<p>then</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\begin{align}
f_2(x) &= \int_0^{r^2 - x} f_1(x + z) \, q(z) \, dz \\
       &= 1 - \frac{x}{r^2}
\end{align} %]]></script>

<p>Expected value will be defined as</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\int_0^{r^2} 2x \, f_2(x) \, dx = \int_0^{r^2} 2x - \frac{2x^2}{r^2} \, dx =
2x^2/2 - 2x^3 / 3r^2  = 2r^4 / 2 - 2r^4 / 3 = r^2 (1 / 3)</script>

<h3 id="generalizing-calculations-for-ps-geq-i">Generalizing calculations for \(P(s \geq i)\)</h3>

<p>The same integration process could be used to derive exected are of a circle.
After doing all of the calculations it could be shown that \(P(W\text{ | }g=i)
= \frac{1}{i}\)</p>

<h3 id="final-result">Final result</h3>

<p>The final result will look like this</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\begin{align}
\mathbb{E}[s] &= P(s \geq 1) + P(s \geq 2) + P(s \geq 3) + P(s \geq 4) + ... \\
              &= 1 + \frac{\pi}{4} + (\frac{\pi}{4})^2 \, \frac{1}{2} +
(\frac{\pi}{4})^3 \, \frac{1}{6} + ... \\
              &= \sum_0^{\infty} (\frac{\pi}{4})^i \, \frac{1}{i!}
\end{align} %]]></script>

<p>Expression above is just a taylor series expansion of the exponential function
at the point \(x=\frac{\pi}{4}\)</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\mathbb{E}[s] = e^{\frac{\pi}{4}}</script>

<h2 id="validating-results-with-a-simple-simulation">Validating results with a simple simulation</h2>

<p>It‚Äôs very easy to simulate this game 10 million times with a few lines of code.
At the end, we can average all of the scores and compare obtained number with
the answer. Because it‚Äôs a simulation, we don‚Äôt expect to see exactly the same
number, but the average produced by a simulation should be very close to what we
expect.</p>
