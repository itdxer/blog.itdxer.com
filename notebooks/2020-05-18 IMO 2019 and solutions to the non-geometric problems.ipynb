    "It's obvious that the only way the game cannot be finished is when a fully connected graph or a sub-graph with 3 or more nodes has been created. In this context, a subgraph is a subset of nodes which is completely disconnected from all other nodes, but all nodes within this set are connected to each other. Itâ€™s impossible to finish the game because we need to have \"missing\" edges in the graph in order to make a move.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another important observation is that with each step we reduce the total number of links in the graph by 2. For example, let's focus on 3 nodes, namely A, B and C. Let's say A-B and A-C are connected, but B and C are not connected (just like in the example above). We can say that A has 2 friends, B has 1 friend and C also has 1 friend. After 1 operation we get A with no connections, which means that this person has 0 friends, but B and C have 1 friend each (exactly as it was before). Of course, B and C got different friends, but the number of friends remained the same. We can think that during each step we reduce the number of edges by 2 in one and only one node. It means that when a node has an odd number of friends we will never be able to get 0 edges for this node. Nodes with an odd number of edges will have at least 1 edge at the end of the game. But it's not a problem for nodes that have an even number of nodes. For them, a node could be isolated from all other nodes which means that it will have 0 edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "At least in principle, we should be able to get to a group of users with 0 or 1 connection, but we cannot just subtract 2 edges from some random node per each event, since the node might not have any legal moves that would allow us to get rid of the two edges. Simple example is a fully connected graph that has 3 nodes where each node is connected to each other.\n",

Second case is impossible, since we have only 1009 nodes with 1010 edges. The first option could have been possible, but the problem is that we have 1009 nodes with 1010 edges in addition to 1010 nodes with 1009 edges which means that we cannot have fully connected subgraphs with 1010 nodes and 1009 edges. It's easy to see. Let's take 1 node that has 1010 edges. This node can be connected to all other 1008 nodes with 1010 edges, but we will need to connect it to 2 more nodes in order to get 1010 edges. This means that this node has to be connected to at least 2 nodes that have 1009 connections. And this implies that each node with 1009 edges should be connected to at least 1 node with 1010 friends and it means that we cannot have a fully connected subgraph in the graph."

First, notice that in each step some node in the graph loses 2 edges. Because we cannot get nodes with an odd number of edges we will have to end up with a graph that has no edges at all. This goal is clearly impossible. Let's imagine that this is possible. Imagine that we are one step before a graph with no edges has been formed. Since we remove 2 edges each step it implies that there should be a single node with two edges. This is impossible, because if one node is connected to some other node then there must be another node with more than one edge which is a contradiction.
