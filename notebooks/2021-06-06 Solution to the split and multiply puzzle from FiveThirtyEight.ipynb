    "\n",
    "> Max the Mathemagician is calling for volunteers. He has a magic wand of length 10 that can be broken anywhere along its length (fractional and decimal lengths are allowed). After the volunteer chooses these breakpoints, Max will multiply the lengths of the resulting pieces. For example, if they break the wand near its midpoint and nowhere else, the resulting product is 5Ã—5, or 25. If the product is the largest possible, they will win a free backstage pass to his next show. (Amazing, right?)\n",
