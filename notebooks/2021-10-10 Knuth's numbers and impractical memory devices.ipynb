In fact, the estimates are exact if we think each device represents a digit of the number encoded in binary/ternary base or [mixed radix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_radix). In other words, the relation between cells is multiplicative with respect to the memory's size. For example, in binary memory devices, the total number of possible states can be obtained by multiplying the memory sizes of all individual cells. Multiplicative relations between cells make them extremely practical in real-world applications since memory size scales exponentially with respect to the number of cells.\n",

For example, we can create a memory device with four distinct states; if we add one more binary cell to it, the device will be able to store five distinct states. Although the device doesn't utilise cells efficiently, it has useful properties. Such a device can be designed to have any desired number of distinct states, whereas, with binary memory devices, it's only possible if the number happens to be a power of two. Additive memory devices are easy to design (but perhaps difficult to build in practice). If one wants a memory unit that stores exactly \\\\(N\\\\) distinct states, then we will need \\\\(N-1\\\\) binary cells to store it. If each cell stores 0 or 1, we just have to count the number of cells that were set to 1, and the number will represent the state in which the device is. It's easy to see that such a device will be able to store exactly \\\\(N\\\\) distinct states.\n",
