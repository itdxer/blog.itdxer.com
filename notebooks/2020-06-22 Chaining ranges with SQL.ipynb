Super ranges have useful property which normal ranges don't have - they do not overlap with each other.. We can sort them either using start or end time and end up with the sequence that has the following property \\\\(S_i \\leq E_i < S_{i+1} \\leq E_{i+1}\\\\) (one super range will be a special case for which \\\\(i=1\\\\) and 2nd range doesn't exist). Even if we don't know what ranges do we have we can say for sure that \\\\(S_i \\leq s_k \\leq e_k \\leq E_i\\\\) from which we can see that \\\\(s_k \\leq e_k < S_{i+1} \\leq E_{i+1}\\\\).
