    "Let's assume that person A enters the casino with \\\\(N\\\\) dollars and wants to play the game until wins \\\\(2N\\\\) dollars. The person A is determined to follow the martingale betting strategy and play the fair roulette wheel until loses all of the money in which case person A will have to leave the casino with no money. Imagine that instead of going to a casino that person plays with person B that also has \\\\(N\\\\) dollars and the game ends when person A or B ends up with no money (and the other player gets \\\\(2N\\\\) dollars). It's easy to see that if player A plays with another player or casino it has no effect on the game since it doesn't change the final goal of the game or intermediate outcomes. So each turn person A makes a bet by putting a certain amount of money on red or black and person B puts exactly the same amount of money on the opposite color. The following set up exactly reflects how the casino works for our specific problem and shows it from the perspective of the two person zero-sum game. It's very easy to see why this is a zero-sum game, because only one person wins and takes all of the money on the table, so the loss for one person is a gain for another. In addition, since our casino is fair and all outcomes are i.i.d. it absolutely doesn't matter on which color we bet as long as the person follows the specified strategy. We can also say that the flip of a coin determines on which color person A has to bet, so that none of them actually picks a color on which to bet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can go back to our original problem and understand why the probability below 50% is a strange result. Basically, probability below 50% indicates that person B has a larger probability of winning (above 50%) meaning that strategy which person B follows is actually better. Notice that both players start with the exact amount of money, they both have the exact random chance of winning the game, but the strategy that they follow is the only thing that makes them different. Person B actually follows a slightly different strategy compare to person A. Recall that in the martingale betting strategy each time person A loses the person has to bet double of what was lost and since person B bets the same amount it means that it happens every time person B wins. Person B actually follows quite the opposite strategy. Since the selected color doesn't have any effect on the outcome, the conclusion actually indicates that the strategy used by person B is better.\n",
    "\n",
    "Does it mean that by following the martingale betting strategy we actually discovered another strategy which can be profitable? The answer is NO, since as you remember we started with the assumption that probability of winning is below 50% which as we will see later is false."

It's easy to see that inner expectation doesn't depend on \\\\(N\\\\) or \\\\(D\\\\) when \\\\(M\\\\) is known, but first we'll need to slightly modify the problem in a way that wouldn't effect our expectation. We can imagine the following process. Each time a player makes one dollar bet we can say that the player starts a cycle of the martingale betting strategy. Before starting the cycle the player can calculate what is the maximum number of steps the player can play in one cycle of the strategy given the amount of money that the player has and we can call this value \\\\(M\\\\). It's perfectly fine that a player can play and win in less than \\\\(M\\\\) steps, it's just when the player loses all games within a cycle then the cycle has to be terminated and a new one begins in case the player has enough money. But we can imagine an alternative process. The player can always play \\\\(M\\\\) games within a cycle. It's always the case when player either loses all \\\\(M\\\\) games or loses \\\\(M-1\\\\) games in a row and wins the \\\\(M\\\\)-th game, but when the player wins in \\\\(K\\\\) (\\\\(K \\lt M\\\\)) games we can imagine that the player can just wait near the table the remaining \\\\(M-K\\\\) games without making any bets. Waiting near the table has no effect on the expectation since the player doesn't gain or lose money by doing that. So now in \\\\(M\\\\) games (including those where player doesn't play the game) player can lose \\\\((-2^M + 1)\\\\) dollars with \\\\(1/2^M\\\\) probability or win 1 dollar in which case conditional expectation will be\n",
